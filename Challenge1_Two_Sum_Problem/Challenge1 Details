Question:

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
code must return [0, 1].

Steps i took: 
- I utilized an empty HashMap.
- I looped over the elements of the array.
- For every element in the array -
  If the element exists in the Map, then the code checks if itâ€™s complement which is (target - element) also exists in the Map or not. If the complement exists then it returns the indices of the current element and the complement.
  Otherwise, it put the element in the Map, and move to the next iteration.
